# Eldritch Valheim

Eldritch Valheim is a mod for the game Valheim that introduces eldritch-themed

and Lovecraftian lore.

## Installation

2. Download the Eldritch Valheim mod from the official repository or modding
   community.
3. Extract the contents of the downloaded file into your Valheim
   `BepInEx/plugins` directory.

   R2modman or doorstop commands).

## Features

Xenomorphs: Introduces terrifying alien creatures that roam the world, adding a
new layer of challenge and horror. The AI currently is buggy for movement so it
currently uses the vanilla AI (making the Xeno less realistic).

### Monsters

Xenomorph Drones

- Fast and agile, these creatures hunt in packs and can quickly overwhelm
  players.
- Stealthy predators that can ambush players from the shadows.
- Weakness: Fire. (eventually)
- Behaviors (not released in 1.0.0 due to movement/navigation bugs)
    - Hunt: Circle
    - Hunt: Leap
    - Hunt: Charge (attack and chases player)
    - Hunt: Retreat (will move away)
    - Hunt: Creep (will move towards player if player is not looking in their
      direction or move backwards if player is looking at them).
