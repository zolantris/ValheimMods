# Vehicle Storage

A Guide To Saving and Spawning a Vehicle.

This guide will review how to Save a vehicle. This tutorial is valid for
vehicles above ValheimRAFT `>=3.3.0`.

## Requirements

1. Know how to open
   the [Vehicle-Commands-Interface](Tutorial_VehicleCommandsInterface.md#Vehicle-Commands-Interface)

## Saving a Vehicle

1. Find a vehicle or make a brand-new vehicle.
2. With the vehicle-commands-interface press "Save"

That base path is either R2Modman's folder or the original steam install folder
if you are manually installing.

3. If you already have a save. Just add it there. It can be added while running
   the game. Each time the Scroll menu is opened it will add an item. I believe
   the item order is date time based but it could be name sorted.

4. Select the "black_pearl" or whatever you saved.
5. Ensure you are in a wide area...away from other vehicles. This will prevent
   breaking other vehicles when spawning a new one.
6. Press [Admin] Spawn Vehicle.
